#### Q9. Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words)

``` 
Encapsulation is the feature by which all data and associated methods are bound together as a coherent unit. It also
helps to conrol the information that is shared with the external world, by using features like private methods and 
variables, thereby achieving data hiding.
Example: 
    In the code given below all the data and related methods are encapsulated in Employee class. By declaring all the 
fields as private and providing getters and setters, we can control access and the required behavior when getting or 
setting a property. "calculateAnnualSalary()" is an example of an associated behavior which is also part of the same 
class.
 
```
```java
public class Employee{
    private int employeeId;
    private String employeeName;
    private String company;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(int employeeId, String employeeName, String company, double salary) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.employeeName = employeeName;
        this.company = company;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public int getEmployeeId() {
        return employeeId;
    }

    public void setEmployeeId(int employeeId) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
    }

    public String getEmployeeName() {
        return employeeName;
    }

    public void setEmployeeName(String employeeName) {
        this.employeeName = employeeName;
    }

    public String getCompany() {
        return company;
    }

    public void setCompany(String company) {
        this.company = company;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public double calculateAnnualSalary(){
        return this.salary * 12;
    }
}
```

#### Q10. What is Java Garbage Collection? How It Works?. What is finalize method in Java ? When does an Object
#### becomes eligible for Garbage collection in Java?

``` 
When objects are instantiated using "new" keyword, the memory allocation happens in the JVM heap. 
In Java, the objects that are still referenced by the program are called the live objects and those that are not
referenced are called dead objects. Java Garbage Collection is responsible to keep track of the heap memory, identify
the dead objects and reclaim the unreferenced memory. The garbage collector is executed in a daemon thread. If garbage
collection does not happen, eventually heap will run out of memory and throws "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError".

Garbage collection heppens in 3 steps:
Mark : Maintains an object graph starting from "main" method, traverses it and marks all live objects that will be 
reachable from the root.
Delete : Delete dead objects
Compacting : Compact the available memory by making sure that the allocated memory is contiguous.

finalize() is a method of "java.lang.Object" class which can be overridden. It is a 
non-deterministic operation and can be called just before garbage collector destroys the objects that are not in use. 
finalize() is responsible to free up resources associated with the objects that the Garbage Collector is about to 
destroy. It is generally not advisable to override finalise() because of its non-deterministic nature.

Garbage Collector destroys objects whose life cycle has come to an end, meaning it's no longer referenced in the
program.
